## From freecodecamp

-It is a very old project, I done it last year. I completed it after I learn responsive design. I released it after so much time cause
I did not lear git and github back then which I did recently

-This porject is made from html and css. The piority of making this project was to master css media queries. As I was having hard time
understanding.

-You can find the image responsive

-I set font size as vw but now i am using either px or rem as I find it more comforting.

-The width set as percentage so that it can fit to as needed from devices

-You can find the complete based work on html and css
